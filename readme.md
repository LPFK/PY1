# Python Learning Journey V.2 🐍

This repository documents my progress in learning Python, featuring a collection of exercises, scripts, and mini-projects. The content roughly follows the structure of the CS50P (CS50's Introduction to Programming with Python) curriculum, along with additional personal explorations.

## 📂 Repository Structure

### 📚 Basics & Core Concepts
*   **[Base0](./Base0)**: Introductory scripts covering basic syntax, loops, and functions. Includes simple games like `mario.py` and `hogwarts.py`.
*   **[Exceptions](./Exceptions)** & **[Exercices-3](./Exercices-3)**: Handling errors and exceptions gracefully. Exercises include `fuel.py`, `grocery.py`, and `taqueria.py`.
*   **[Libraries](./Libraries)**: Exploring Python's module system, creating custom packages, and using standard libraries.

### 🧩 Exercises by Topic
*   **[Exercices-0](./Exercices-0)**: Variables, functions, and string manipulation (`faces.py`, `einstein.py`).
*   **[Exercices-1](./Exercices-1)**: Conditionals and control flow (`coke.py`, `plates.py`).
*   **[Exercices-2](./Exercices-2)**: Loops (`camelCase.py`, `twttr.py`).
*   **[Exercices-3](./Exercices-3)**: Exceptions and error handling.
*   **[Exercices-4](./Exercices-4)**: Libraries, APIs, and CLI tools. Features more complex interactions using external modules.

## 🚀 Key Projects

### 1. Team Rocket - Cargo Calculator (`Exercices-4/pokemon_V2.py`)
An interactive CLI application that interacts with the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) to:
*   Search for specific Pokémon stats (Weight, Height, Abilities).
*   Calculate total cargo weight for capturing multiple Pokémon (Team Rocket style!).
*   Visualize base stats with text-based bars.

**Run it:**
```bash
python Exercices-4/pokemon_V2.py
```

### 2. Event Planning App (`Planning_App.py`)
A class-based application for managing events, venues, and participants.
*   **Features:** Create events, assign halls (`Salle`), manage participants, and validate scheduling conflicts.
*   **Concepts applied:** Object-Oriented Programming (Classes `Evenement`, `Salle`, `PlanningManager`), Date/Time handling.

## 🛠️ Technologies & Libraries
*   **Python 3.x**
*   **Requests**: For API interactions (Pokemon project).
*   **Datetime**: For event scheduling.
*   **Typing**: Type hinting for better code analysis.

## 📝 Usage
Feel free to explore any script by running it directly in your terminal:
```bash
python path/to/script.py
```
